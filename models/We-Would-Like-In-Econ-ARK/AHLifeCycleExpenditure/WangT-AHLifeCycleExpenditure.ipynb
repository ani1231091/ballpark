    "### What does this paper do ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides evidence on heterogeneity in sub-category of non-durable consumption over the life cycle, in particular, clothing, food, and nondurable transportation declines after middle-age. \n",
    "- Provides a compositional explanation for the following two well-known facts:  \n",
    "   1. the ''hump''-shaped lifecycle non-durable consumption  \n",
    "   2. steady increase in inequality of non-durable consumption over life cycle \n",
    "- Traditional view is that both facts are due to uninsured permanent income. This paper suggests the pattern was primarily driven by either work-related expenditure or home-production(food).\n",
    "- Calibrated an extended standard model of incomplete market to include two types of good."
