# ### Summary
#
# This paper uses a two-sector OLG model with heterogeneous entrepreneurial agents to explore how wealth and capital income taxation differ in their welfare implications when there is rate-of-return heterogeneity.
#
# The main findings are as follows:
# * With rate-of-return heterogeneity, wealth taxation (as opposed to capital income taxation) shifts the tax burden towards unproductive entrepreneurs, and gives the productive ones better incentives to save. This generates a reallocation of capital towards productive entrepreneurs, raising output and allowing the government to lower labor income taxes.
# * In a model aimed at matching the U.S., the authors simulation exercises display an average welfare gain of 7.5% in consumption terms to newborns from switching from capital income to wealth taxation.
# * In the same model, the authors estimate that the optimal wealth tax rate is 2%-3%. In contrast, if only captial income and labor income taxes were available, it would be optimal to subsidize capital income.

# ### Overview 
#
#
# #### Rate-of-return heterogeneity
#
# The recent empirical literature (e.g. Fagereng, Guiso, Malacrino and Pistaferri (2016a)) has found evidence that there is persistent heterogeneity on the risk-adjusted rates of return that households face on their assets. This is important because:
# * A theoretical result implying that wealth and capital-income taxation are equivalent relies on the assumption that returns on investment are homogeneous.
# * The empirical distribution of wealth has a thick tail that is not easily matched by models without rate-of-return heterogeneity.
#
# #### Non-technical methodological overview
#
# To assess the effects of wealth and capital income taxation, the authors construct a model in which agents have different degrees of entrepreneurial ability which also varies over time and generations. Therefore, unproductive agents can end up with large wealth from their predecesors or their youth. Futhermote, there are financial constraints that prevent wealth from perfectly reallocating to efficient entrepreneurs.
#
# The authors use simulations of the model under different tax policies to find their welfare implications.
#
# #### The two main effect of wealth taxation
#
# Switching from capital income taxes to wealth taxes has two main effects that help in understanding the results of the paper:
# 1. __"Use it or lose it" effect__: under capital income taxes, more productive entrepreneurs pay a higher taxes on their investments. Switching to wealth taxes reduces this phenomenon, redistributing the tax burden towards less productive entrepreneurs and allowing more productive ones to keep more of their capital than before.
#
# 2. __"Behavioral response"__: taxes compress the distribution of after-tax returns, but this phenomenon is much larger under capital income taxation. Thus, switching to wealth taxation spreads the distribution of the effective returns to investment and elicits a saving response that shifts capital towards more productive agents.

# ### The model
#
# #### Households/entrepreneurs
#
# * Households face mortality risk each period and can live up to $H$ years. When they die, they are replaced by an offspring with their wealth. 
# * They supply their labor and use their wealth to produce differentiated intermediate products.
#
# On each period they choose:
# 1. How much labor to supply.
# 2. How much of their income to consume and save.
# 3. How much of their wealth to invest in their own firm versus a riskless bond.
# 4. How much of their intermediate good to produce.
#
# They maximize $$\mathbb{E}_0\left\{ \sum_{h=1}^H \beta^{h-1}\phi_h u(c_h, 1-l_h) \right\}$$ where $\phi_h$ is the unconditional probability of survival up to age $h$.
#
# #### Producers
#
# ##### Intermediate goods
#
# Each household $i$ produces an intermediate good $x_i$ through the linear production function
#
# $$x_{i,h} = z_{i,h}\times k_{i,h}$$
#
# where $z_{i,h}$ is the household's entrepreneurial productivity at age $h$ and $k_{i,h}$ is the ammount of final good used in production.
#
# ##### Final good
#
# A profit-maximizing, price-taking firm uses labor and intermediate goods to produce the final good according to $$Y = Q^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}$$ where $Q=\left( \int x_{i,h}^\mu di dh \right)^{1/\mu}$ and L is aggregate labor.
#
# Notice that Q serves as a quality-adjusted index of capital stock.
#
# #### Labor and entrepreneurial productivity
#
# Entrepreneurial productivity is imprefectly inherited according to
#
# $$log(\bar{z}_i^{child}) = \rho_z log(\bar{z}_i^{parent}) + \varepsilon_{\bar{z}_i}$$
#
# and is altered through a three-state Markov chain $\mathbb{I}_{i,h}\in \{H,L,0\}$ that represents a "fast lane" (in which entrepreneurs with above-median ability are born), a normal state, and entrepreneurial retirement with transition matrix
#
# \begin{equation}
#     \Pi_{\mathbb{I}}\begin{bmatrix}
#     1-p_1-p_2 & p_1 & p_2\\
#     0 & 1-p_2 & p_2 \\
#     0 & 0 & 1
#     \end{bmatrix}.
# \end{equation}
#
# Actual productivity is then defined as
#
# \begin{equation}
# z_{i,h} = \begin{cases}
# \bar{z}_i^\lambda, & \text{if} \quad \mathbb{I}_{i,h} = H\\
# \bar{z}_i, & if \quad \mathbb{I}_{i,h} = L\\
# 0, & if \quad \mathbb{I}_{i,h} = 0\\
# \end{cases}
# \end{equation}
#
# with $\lambda > 1$.
#
# Labor productivity has a permanent imperfectly inherited component, a life cycle component, and a random AR(1) component.
#
# #### The individuals' decision problems
#
# ##### Static production/allocation problem
#
# Given his assets an productivity an entrepreneur decides how much capital to use in his firm
#
# \begin{equation}
#     \pi (a,z) = \max_{k \leq \vartheta(z)a} \{ p(z k)\times zk - (r+\delta)k \}
# \end{equation}
#
# where $p(\cdot)$ gives the price of the intermediate good. Notice that there is a collateral constraint, where $\vartheta(z)\geq 1$ and non-decreasing.
#
# ##### Dynamic problem
#
# The problem and value function of a household of age $h$ is given by
#
# \begin{align}
#     V_h(a;\mathbf{S}) = &\max_{c,l,a'} u(c,1-l) + \beta\frac{\phi_{h+1}}{\phi_{h}} \mathbb{E}[V_{h+1}(a',\mathbf{S}')|S]\\
#     \text{s.t.} \quad & a' = \mathcal{Y}(a,l;z,e,\kappa;\mathcal{T}) - c(1+\tau_c)\\
#     & a'\geq 0
# \end{align}
#
# where $\mathcal{Y}$ denotes the total disposable income of the individual after production and taxation, $\mathbf{S}$ is the vector of individual exogenous states, and $\mathcal{T}$ represents the tax system.
#
# #### Government
#
# The government can tax consumption, labor income, capital income, and wealth. It uses its funds to fund pension payments to retirees and a fixed level of exogenous expenditure. It is assumed to always run a balanced budget.

# ### Results
#
# The authors conduct various experiments. We now report the main ones.

# %% [markdown]
# #### Substituting capital income taxes for wealth taxes
#
# Here, the authors ask what would happen if the government left consumption and labor income taxes at their current levels, eliminates capital income taxes ($\tau_k=0$) and introduced wealth taxes ($\tau_a$) at a rate enough to keep pension payments constant at their pre-reform levels.
#
# The following table presents the equilibrium changes of macroeconomic variables induced by this change (in the columns labeled RN).
#
# <center><img src="Table5.png" style="height:400px"></center>
#
# The results show that output and consumption increase through an increase in the quality-adjusted capital stock and labor. Intuitively, the tax change leads not only to both an increase and a reallocation of $K$ towards more efficient entrepreneurs ($\Delta Q > \Delta K$). This gain in efficiency allows for higher wages and incentivizes a greater labor supply.
#
# The next table (on the RN panel) shows how the welfare changes from the experiment are distributed across age and entrepreneurial ability. The welfare change is calculated as the perpetual percentage change in consumption that would make agents indifferent between the pre and post-change equilibria.
#
# <center><img src="Table9.png" style="height:400px"></center>
#
# The welfare effects are largely possitive except for retirees, who face a higher tax rate on their wealth with their pensions held constant.

# #### Optimal taxation
#
# In this section the authors consider a government that is maximizing the welfare of a newborn by choosing either
# 1. The capital income tax rate and the labor income tax rate. Denoted OCIT.
# 2. The wealth tax rate and the labor income tax rate. Denoted OWT.
# subject to the constraint of raising enough revenues to pay for its expenditures and for social security.
#
# The following table presents the results optimal tax rates and average welfare gains from each of the experiments (OCIT in the column labeled $\tau_k$ and OWT in the column labeled $\tau_a$).
#
# <center><img src="Table10.png" style="height:400px"></center>
#
# The table shows that both reforms produce average welfare gains, that the optimal income capital tax in the OCIT case is a large subsidy, and that the optimal wealth tax in the OWT case is just above 3%. The average welfare gain is greater under wealth taxation.
#
# The following table examines the welfare changes in macroeconomic variables under the two scenarios (on the columns $\tau_k$ and $\tau_a$)
#
# <center><img src="Table11.png" style="height:400px"></center>
#
# The table shows that under OCIT a very large increase in the stock of capital occurs, given that its returns are subsidized. Also, as the government needs to balance its budget given the subsidies, labor income taxes are increased and thus, the increase in after-tax wages is modest, so there are level gains with distributional losses. On the other hand, under OWT, there is a very modest increase in the stock of capital, but a large gain in efficiency (compare $Q$ with K and see and TFP) due to the reallocation mechanism. Since the wealth tax allows for a lower labor income tax rates, higher after-tax wages and a labor increase.
#
# This experiment shows that the OCIT shifts the tax burden from capital to labor, and the OWT does the opposite.
#
# An important point to consider is that since under OCIT the capital stock must dramatically increase, accounting for a transition period generates short term welfare losses given that higher savings are required. The required thightening is much softer under OWT, since the increase in the capital stock is subtle. This point strengthens the argument for wealth taxes.

# ### Conclusion
#
# In the presence of rate-of-return heterogeneity, capital income taxes disproportionately affect productive entrepreneurs. Switching to wealth taxation moves the tax burden towards unproductive entrepreneurs and increases after-tax return heterogeneity, which elicits a reallocation of capital towards productive entrepreneurs. The increased efficiency and the expanded tax base increase output and allow the government to reduce labor income taxes. The authors therefore conclude that wealth taxation can increase efficiency and output while decreasing consumption inequality.
#
# Through simulation exercises calibrated to match U.S. data, the authors find that the optimal wealth tax rate is around 3%.
